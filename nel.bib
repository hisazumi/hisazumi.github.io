abstract = {In this paper, the authors present SMArch, an inter-organizational software architecture for smart mobility, which can be defined as services coordinating multi-modal mobility. The architecture is extended from the Japanese system architecture for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which is defined in 1999 and used for a reference giving a shared vision among stakeholders involved in ITS. Although the Japanese ITS architecture focuses road traffic only, SMArch focuses any mobility including not only road vehicles but also airplanes and ships. Moreover, SMArch introduces the service path concept, handles the itinerary as a series of mobility services and staying services such as lodging, dining and parking. Service coordinating agents present service path candidates satisfying the given traveler's requirements. The agents and other services interact to search for such service path candidates with the service path query language defined based on the service path concept and the information model defined in the SMArch.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the development of embedded software, the demand for context-aware software and the need for Context-Oriented Programming (COP) frameworks is increasing. In general, within the COP framework, each method is managed in units of layers, and time is required to activate the layers following context changes. Compared to the traditional single-thread method, the use of multi-threading to control the layer activation doubles the system efficiency. Moreover, embedded software usually includes mechanisms for exception handling, such as communication disconnection, mechanical or hardware failures, and insufficient energy. These mechanisms are expected to be types of high-priority operations, which also require multi-threading to achieve preemptive layer activation. In this study, we propose an architecture for preemptive layer activation known as PLAM by using multi-threading, which is based on the RTCOP framework. Using PLAM, the non-exception handling layers can be activated simultaneously, and when the context of the exception handling layer is perceived, the program can call a certain function to suspend or terminate the activation process of the other layers. Finally, we package a series of functions as APIs so that users can use these to customize the context listener. A test application confirms the feasibility of the proposed approach.},
